# poc-idn-usecases

This is a proof of concept experiment in gathering community led data management capability stories (techs would call this "use cases").

It is offered as a possible model for how the IDN may seek, collate, share and discuss users data stories. The aim is to use this information to:

 * welcome input from everyone who believes that "data" and "data capability" is important to Indigenous people; 
 * help guide the priorities of the ARDC HASS-I project (over the next 12-18 months); 
 * help identify the scale and content of current and future Indigenous data needs which may be beyond the scope or resourcing of the current project;
 * share understandings of what we really mean by "Indigenous data capability", ID-SOV, IG-GOV and CARE principles;
 * build shared committments about what kinds of data and data capabilities is important;

# TASK: Collection of users data stories

An user data story is a short and simple description of an application which is about indigenous data (e.g. a safe keeping place to store my data, exercise control over data projects, how to find out what data exists about me, access to community shared semantic descriptions of observable properties).

A user story should be fundamentally a one-sentence description of what a particular type of user wants the solution to achieve, and why they want that. We are expanding the concept to include more complete narratives that can more fully explain your one-sentence user story. 

## Instructions

To initiate a user story, [Get Started](https://github.com/rdxx-sandpit/poc-idn-usecases/issues/new?assignees=&labels=user+story&template=user-story-submission-template.md&title=Role+-+Desired+Action+-+Benefit). (If there is some problem, go to the Issues tab for the repository, click <kbd>New issue</kbd>, then click on <kbd>Get Started</kbd> using the "User story submission template".)

If you just want to create a regular ticket that isn't a user story, then [Open a blank issue](https://github.com/rdxx-sandpit/poc-idn-usecases/issues/new).

### Filling out the name

The ideal name is quite short, unique, and makes it easy to find your user story. 
If you can replace the each component of the suggested title (Role, Desired Action, and Benefit) with one or two words
to uniquely define your story, that's recommended. If not, make the title whatever you think will help you and others find it.

### Filling out the template

There are five sections. In the first three sections, replace the one-line description with a single phrase to complete that part.
Remember that the user story is read by putting the first three sections together, so short phrases are most helpful.

The fourth section helps us categorize the user story, and can be a few keywords reflecting the research domain to which your user story applies. (Feel free to provide IRIs from controlled vocabularies here. XXXX add link to baby vocabs XXXXX :-) )

Look at some of the other user stories for inspiration, and remember that you have a section at the end into which you can add
all the details that help define your complete user story.

### Submission and Editing

Be sure to submit your user story using the <kbd>Submit new issue</kbd> button at the very bottom of the page.

You can go back and edit your story at any time by visiting it (while logged in to GitHub), clicking on the <kbd>...</kbd> icon at the upper right of your story and selecting <kbd>Edit</kbd> from the context menu. After you are finished, make sure to hit the <kbd>Update comment</kbd> button to save your changes.

If you save an incomplete story, put (Incomplete) in the title so readers know you are still working on it.
